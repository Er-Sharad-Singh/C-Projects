# ðŸ’» C Language & Advanced Concepts â€“ 100+ Questions + 10 Projects

Welcome to my C programming journey! This repository contains the projects I built after completing **40+ hours** of C programming (Basics to Advanced) under the guidance of **Prashant Sir (KG Coding â€“ YouTube Channel)**.

## ðŸ“˜ What I Accomplished:
- âœ… Learned C Language from basics to advanced level
- âœ… Solved 100+ coding problems (beginner to advanced)
- âœ… Built 10 real-world, hands-on projects using pure C
- âœ… Gained experience with logic building, file handling, recursion, and console-based UI
