# üíª C Language & Advanced Concepts ‚Äì 100+ Questions + 10 Projects

Welcome to my C programming journey! This repository contains the projects I built after completing **40+ hours** of C programming (Basics to Advanced) under the guidance of **Prashant Sir (KG Coding ‚Äì YouTube Channel)**.

## üìò What I Accomplished:
- ‚úÖ Learned C Language from basics to advanced level
- ‚úÖ Solved 100+ coding problems (beginner to advanced)
- ‚úÖ Built 10 real-world, hands-on projects using pure C
- ‚úÖ Gained experience with logic building, file handling, recursion, and console-based UI

## üêç **Snake Game (Console Version)**  
   ‚û§ Created a classic Snake game fully in the terminal/console window.  
   ‚ú¶ Controlled snake movement using arrow keys  
   ‚ú¶ Used `gotoxy()` to update position dynamically  
   ‚ú¶ Handled food generation, score tracking, and collision detection (with wall & self)  
   ‚û§ Learned how to manage real-time input, coordinate systems, game loop, and delay logic.


## ‚ôü Tic Tac Toe Game Modes

- **Standard Mode**: Player vs Computer (easy, random logic)
- **God Mode**: Player vs Computer (Minimax Algorithm ‚Äì impossible to win!)

## üí∞ **Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC Quiz Game)**  
   ‚û§ Built a quiz game inspired by the popular KBC format.  
   ‚ú¶ **Timeout System** ‚Äì Each question has a time limit using `time.h`  
   ‚ú¶ **Life System** ‚Äì Limited wrong attempts (e.g., 3 lives) before game ends  
   ‚ú¶ Included lifelines, score tracking, and question bank from file  
   ‚û§ Learned conditional nesting, file-based questions, string handling, and time logic.
